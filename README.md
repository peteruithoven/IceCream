# IceCream
In the programming language you feel most comfortable, write a program that prints
the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Ice” instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print “Cream”. For numbers which are multiples
of both three and five print “IceCream”. This exercise should not take you more than
10 minutes.
